# CrackTech - Tech Interview Preparation

## Current Version: v2.2.0

## CrackTech - Tech Interview Preparation (previously *CrackTech-LeetCode Company Tag, DSA Preparation*) helps you to prepare for your next tech interview

Are you?
- Preparing for your technical interviews. 
- Looking for the **DSA questions** asked by companies like Microsoft, Google, Meta, Apple.
- Looking for a list of **system design** contents
- Looking for a list of **low-level design** contents
- Looking for a list of **test engineering** topics
- Looking for a list of **behavioral** contents

Then this extension can be a good friend to you.

This extension is my effort to make your preparation one step better. I am continuously updating company information solely; you might not get company information for every single problem. I collect company information from different sources on the internet, like blogs, job sites, Glassdoor etc., and update it in my database. So in some cases, you might get **some more company information** than Leetcode provides.

Install this extension/add-on and boost your prep. Wishing you all the very best in your journey.
